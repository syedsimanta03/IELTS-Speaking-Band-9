#### PRACTICE

IELTS Speaking Task 1:

Are there any environmental problems in your country?

Absolutely yes, the most common environmental issue in my hometown is exhausted emissions produced
by cars and motorbikes have been afflicting the air and water quality. My government is struggling to deal
with the problem.

Do you take an interest in nature?

Of course yes, as a city person, I barely have an opportunity to experience the natural environment. Then
whenever I have a holiday, I really prefer to go to the far-off destination, so I could get closer to the nature
and discover the natural world.

Do you or your family take steps to help the environment?

Yes, we do. We always turn of lights or electronic appliances when they are unnecessary. Although this is
minor action, but I believe that it could make significantly contribution to the environment.

IELTS Speaking Task 2:

Describe environmental pollution in your city.

```
 What type of pollution is/are?
 Why it had happened?
 And explain how this pollution can be controlled?
```
Sample answer:

I have been living in Hanoi for almost 8 years, then I have the chance to see how the city has changed in
these years. Due to the increasing number of tourist, Hanoi’ environment has been polluted significantly.
Indeed, many people traveling to there has thrown illegally thrown rubbish into the land and water, which
causes to land and water pollution. In addition, industrial and household waste from factories and
families is contributing to the high level of pollution.

In order to solve this issues, I would recommend the Hanoi’s authority to heavily fine who are caught
realising trash into the atmosphere. By carrying out the rule, people being intent to litter the environment will


be afraid of being punished, which can deter them from discharging unlawful waste. Another solution is that
the government should run some campaigns to raise the awareness of people about how important the
environment is. For example, showing local people and visitors the danger of global warming and
greenhouse effect that I believe could change their attitude towards the protection of environment, which is
likely to have a good impact on air quality.

Although the two actions above are just simple, I think it will be an effective way to mitigate the
environmental contamination in a long-term.

IELTS Speaking Part 3:

What do you think is the main danger the world face in term of environment?

It would have to be global warming, which cause some natural disasters such as flash flood and drought.
The problem mainly stems from enhanced greenhouse effect in recent year. I believe that several steps
should be taken to deal with the issue.

What example are there of how we damage the natural world?

There are factories that release toxic waste directly into the air and water, which is main cause of air and
water pollution. As a result, loss of habitats is increasingly common, many people are diagnosed with
health problems such as lung and throat cancer. In addition, a large number of land and rain forests are
destroyed to make a way for agriculture field.

IELTS Speaking Part 1:

Do you live in a house or an apartment?

At the moment, I am living in my parents’ house, but in future I am moving in University, and I am gonna
live on campus in a double room.

What kind of accommodation do most people live in your city?


It depends on where they live. For instance, People who live in urban areas usually live in houses while those
who inhabit in urban areas would stay in apartments because there is not enough place for building houses.

IELTS Speaking Part 2:

Describe a house or an apartment that you would like to live in. You should say

```
 What kind of accommodation it would be
 where it would be
 who would live there with you
 and why you would enjoy living in this place
```
Sample answer:

Since I was a young boy, I have always dreamed of my future home. Today I would like to share with you
about my ideal place that I would love to live in. It seems to me that urban environment is perfectly suitable
for my personality and my needs, then living in an apartment block in a metropolitan is the best choice for
me.

Because owning my own home means that I could do whatever and whenever I like, I have constantly
wanted to make my dreamed apartment become true as soon as possible. In there I would live with my future
family, there should be a small family of my two children, my wife and myself. Thus, the apartment should
be in high floors such as 15th or above, and of course my place should have to be spacious, which is about
200 square meters that means my kids could have enough space to play. There might be a living room, a
kitchen, three bedrooms and one balcony. In my ideal apartment, it should be equipped with mod cons, so
when it comes to cleaning the house, we will find it easier.

Also I would plan to put tables and chairs out in my balcony, then I could sit in, have a cup of tea with my
wife and experience the city’s view. This I believe will be a memorable memory for my beloved family.

IELTS Speaking Part 3:

Is it better to own your own home or to rent?

I would go for rented accommodation because of its potential advantages. The first benefit is that people
who rent a house will not need to take out a mortgage and just pay rent in advance, which normally costs
them a small amount of money. Another benefit is this house will not be their permanent address, which
means they can move to anywhere they like.

What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for yourself?

The important thing is they can enjoy finding their own home, then another thing is owning their own home,
which means that they could do whatever they like. For example, by doing up a property, they can organize
and decorate their house in a way that suits their expectation.

worked my way through university. Although I was very busy at that time, I believe that it was the best time
in my student’s lives, in which I joined in many clubs and activities, which gave me the chance to experience
social lives, and make new friends.

Another thing that I remembered is when I was struggling to choose my major at university and received help

such as human resources management, accounting, finance I would follow. Knowing that friends who had been
studying with me for a long time might know me better than myself, I came to some of my friends and asked

constantly gets done up. Also, due to her slim figure, it is very easy for her to choose clothes. Normally, she
wears jeans with white shirts, but when it is necessary, she suits up for formal events. Then I think all of this

was a little child, she was like my best friends, we shared laugh and happiness together. And when I was

foundation of a good friendship. If you are dishonest, you cannot be trustworthy. Also children should be
self-assured and self-confident, which could help them a lot in their lives.

Absolutely yes, I am fond of playing football with my friends after school, because we are big fan of
football, and whenever playing it, we have a lot of fun with that and feel a sense of enjoyment.

Do you watch sports on TV?

Football is my favorite sport to watch on TV. Since I a huge football fan, I have barely missed football
matches of my favorite team including away games and home games. I prefer to spend my Sunday night
staying at home to see a match with my father.

What is the most popular sport in your country?

In my opinion, I believe football is the most common sport in my country. This is because it is not too hard to
take up the sport, in addition in term of watching a football match, this can bring so much fun to viewer, not

Band 8.0 Sample answer:

Since I was a little boy, I began to fall for football, and until now I have ever stopped loving the sport. At the
very beginning, I first came to know football when my father took me to watch a football match in which our
local team played against their biggest competitor. Although our team lose that match, but I knew that they
had trained hard to prepare for the big match, also during the match, they showed their determination to
win that game. All of this made me to love our team and to start to fall in love with the interesting sport. After
that, I always followed our local team, and asked my father to buy season tickets, then I would never miss any
games of my favorite team.

Apart from watching football, I am also into playing it. Thus, whenever I have spare time, I prefer to spend on
playing football with my friends, which is not only easy for us to take up but also give us a sense of enjoyment.
Though it make me sweat a lot anytime I play with the ball, I love the fact that I always have great time with
my buddy. In addition, I was really proud that by playing football regularly I can get into shape, then my
relatives compliment on my fit body each time we meet.

Finally, I believe that does not matter that how busy I will be in the future, I will constantly spend a part of my
time on football, and my love for football will never be faded.

IELTS Speaking Part 3:

Should people be encouraged more to take up sport?

Definitely yes, the most important reason is that playing sports can be regarded as a recreational activity.
Indeed, while in the modern world individuals have to suffer from high level of stress at work or school, so
this activity can allow people to reduce stress significantly and feel comfortable. Another reason is anticipating
in sport will give people the opportunity to socialize, which means they can meet and make new friends.


**_Which sport do you think are best for people aren’t used to physical activity?_**

In my point of view, these kind of people wont prefer strenuous exercise, so brisk walk can be the great
choice, because the sport does not require high level of fitness. Also, going on a brisk walk regularly help
people to keep fit and have a good effect on their health. People who aren’t used to physical activity can also
choose swimming, which is easy to take up and after go swimming, they can feel a sense of freshness.

holiday destination & quite near my house. It took us about 30 minutes to get there. Since we did not prefer
package holiday, we chose to explore the place by ourselves, which would be flexible for us to travel.

We got up at 6 am, and started to go there by car. When we were on the way travelling to there, we saw
hordes of tourists along the road, which made me feel really excited. After 30-minute drive, eventually my
family and I arrived in 6.30 am. Then my sister and I began to prepare the food and drink, while my parents
set up the tent. After finishing preparation stage, me and my older sister went sightseeing around the park,
and it is interesting that although the park is not a famous destination, there are breathtaking views that I
barely could experience in the city areas. When we got hungry, we ate sandwiches that we prepared at home.

On the sun was about to go down, we gathered around the fire and grilled the beefs and potatoes for the
dinner, then we sang a song. At that moment I did not think of anything and my mind went blank, I felt like I
can get away from it all. Then we had the chance to talk with each other, spend our quality time to share

Sample Answer:

Well, I would like to talk about my soulmate Jess, who used to be my classmate in high school. She was one
of the most impressive friends of mine and a really talented person.

I can say that our friendship goes back years when we were little kids. Being a gregarious girl, she was the
person who started our very first conversation and then we stroke up our relationship and quickly hit it off
with each other. I have to admit that I really enjoy Jess’s company because we can share a lot of things with
each other have a lot in common, which makes us can talk all day long.

For me, Jess is one of the most wonderful girls on earth. I feel that Van was really diligent. I still remember
she was always the first to come and the last to leave our class though she was a grade-A student in class. I
was encouraged as well. She often told me that genius comes from one percent of inspiration and ninety-nine
per cent of perspiration, and I really admire and appreciate her diligence and responsibility. What amazed
me more was that she was so versatile. In addition to being an excellent student, she was also talented and


good at other fields. For example, she was proficient in English and Japanese; she excels in playing the
piano, and more surprisingly, she was even good at calligraphy. How impressive that was!

I’m constantly amazed by her open-mindedness – she’s never judgmental. I wish I could be like that. But
she’s very reliable – if I call her or give her a message, she always response. We’ve always got on well and
we hardly ever fall out with each other.

Personally, she was the one I always wanted to be, and she set a good example for me to follow.

All in all, those are the reasons why when I read the question that you gave me, Jess is the first person that
came to my mind.

IELTS Speaking Part 3:

Question 1: Do you think marriage is still as important as ever?

From my perspective, marriage is always a turning point for anybody. In my country, when a couple really
falls heads over heels in love with each other, they will tie the knot to show their commitment and to
demonstrate that they are ready to start a family and go through ups and downs with each other.

Question 2: Is it important to keep in contact with our friends when we’re in a relationship?

Sure ... it’s so easy to drift apart from your friends when you fall in love. But we always need to have
friends’ companies so try to keep in touch with them by spending weekends to hang out, writing some
letters for them each month or giving them small gifts to cement the relationship.

impression about the refrigerator is tall gray rectangle box, and what is really interesting is that when I stand
in front of the fridge, it can reflect my image like a mirror, then I always prefer to look myself into it rather
than a real mirror.

While the main purpose of the fridge is keeping food and drink longer by keeping it at the low temperature, it
has other functions such as power cooling mode and power saving. When the power cooling mode is on, the
temperature inside the fridge could be went down faster than on a normal mode. Due to the power saving

attack your computer anywhere and anytime, then your important information will be leaked easily.

#### PRACTICE

IELTS Speaking Part 1:

What do you do?

At the moment, I am a student, but I also do some voluntary work at my university, in which I can gain a lot
of precious experience.

Do you have any career plan yet?

Yes, I have, I would like to be self-employed down the road because I am not fond of a nine-to-five job. I
hope that I can run that sales clothes and accessories.

IELTS Speaking Part 2:

Describe your ideal job. You should say

```
 What this job is?
 Whether you would need any qualifications?
 Whether it would be easy to find work?
```
And say why you would enjoy this job in particular?

Band 8.0 sample answer:

Everyone has their dream job, and I am no exception. Since I was a little boy, it has been my dream to work as
human resources management in a multinational company. What make me really want to have the job because
I am fond of interacting with other people, then working in the work place will give me the chance to deal
with human relationships, not to mention that a teacher from my university compliment on my leader skills
and he said that I have the ability to organize people to work together and lead them to boost the productivity,
which is one of the reason driving me to the job.

Generally, working in human resources field is likely to be well paid, besides it also challenging for me to
find work in the area because the position will require high level of qualification and large amount of
experience. Thus, to prepare for my career, I have gained a bachelor in business administration, and I am
about to do a mater degree in the field, in which I will specialized in human resources management. Apart from
my studies, at that time I did my bachelor, I also took part in several voluntary work. By doing that, I have
got a great deal of valuable experience such as social skills and business knowledge as well. I hope that all of
this can help me to take my ideal job easier.

IELTS Speaking Part 3:

If there are a limited number of jobs available who should be given priority, young people or older
people with more experience?

I believe that it should be young worker, although you people cannot possess a rich source of knowledge like
the elderly does, they are full of energy, then can motivate other coworkers to work harder, which could have


a good effect on the company. additionally, recent years older workers tend to take early retirement, then
job vacancies is always available for young people.

What are the disadvantages of working for someone else?

The first things is people being an employee will be put under a lot of pressure. For instance, the workers will
have heavy workloads and always have to work to meet the deadlines, which is really stressful. In addition,
working for someone means you will have less time to relax and be with your family.

## 12. How to Boost Your Vocabulary Score in IELTS?

A proper grasp of vocabulary is definitely one of the most important criteria in the IELTS test. Not only does
vocabulary make up 25% of your mark in IELTS writing and speaking but it also plays a crucial part in IELTS

##### Listening & Writing.

However, a vast majority of IELTS learners (90%) don’t build up their vocabulary in the right way. Lots of
them have downloaded long lists of words without having seen them used in context before and thought that
they could simply learn them by memorising (US Memorizing). This is the single worst thing to improve
their vocabulary skill. Why? The point is that words rarely have only one strict meaning, so learning out
of context is, in essence, is an absurd idea. It means that they don’t fully expose the words within a sentence
and paragraph, thereby not figuring out how to use them properly. Therefore, to gain high score in vocabulary,
IELTS learners have to use suitable words in each situation, not by using new and strange ones.

So my advice is that instead of learning difficult & strange words, you should focus on examining the words
in context, together with learning word forms (countable, uncountable, noun, verb,...) , collocations related to
these words ( followed by which adjectives, verbs or nouns...).

Let’s get down to improving your range of vocabulary in the effective way with the following 5-step plan to
have a flexible use of a rich variety of vocabulary:

1. Read & Listen! Most vocabulary words are learned from context so let’s pick a TV show, radio, podcast,
magazine or book that interest you. (Bear in mind that you shouldn’t force yourself to watch or read something
you are not a fan of because you can feel distracted and then can’t stick to your plan). The more words you’re
exposed to; the better vocabulary you will have. While you read, pay close attention to words you don’t know
& how they are used. First, try to figure out their meanings from context. Then look the words up.
**2. Get in the habit of looking up words you don’t know.** It is absolutely essential to set up at least either of
the online dictionaries named O **xford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary** and Cambridge Advanced
**Learner’s** Dictionary. Keep in mind to keep it open and handy with thesauruses on its tool bar to look up any
new word you are not entirely sure of. Beside each word you should jot down a brief note of the meaning,
collocations, synonyms, example sentences, antonyms and pronunciation. You can also draw pictures, relate
the word to words you already know or do whatever to remember the word.

```
 Firstly, you can look up the dictionary to check if you used it correctly (its meaning, its form) and read the
examples they made.
```
For example: you used “knowledges” instead of “knowledge” –> you ‘re wrong.

```
 Secondly, check the synonym
Synonym: knowledge = understanding, perception, comprehension
Then, read an example sentence or two:
My teacher was well-known for his great knowledge, the most of which she had obtained from books.
 Then, checking collocations:
```

For example:

```
Wrong Right
```
```
large knowledge broad knowledge
```
```
Contribute in something Contribute to something
```
```
Expensive price High price
```
```
Scarce population Sparse population
```
```
a flock of fish a school of fish
```
REMEMBER TO DOUBLE-CHECK ALL OF WORDS YOU USED

3. Own one notebook: Have your own notebook and take note all of new words with meaning, collocations,
examples, synonyms and the mistakes you made when using these words.
4. Use mnemonics (memory tricks): Learning a word won’t help very much if you promptly forget it.
Research shows that it takes from 10 to 20 repetitions to really make a word part of your vocabulary. Therefore,
you had better review the new words after 10 minutes **–** one day **–** 4 days **–** one week **–** two weeks **–** one
month **–** two months (based on spaced repetition, a learning technique to exploit the psychological spacing
effect). Also, practice using the new words in a sentence.
5. Practice, practice, practice!

You should use the new words you noted down in your speaking, writing and check your vocabulary regularly
to make sure you the words stick in your long-term memory. You can use the following materials to practice
at home:

The human mind can effectively remember up to 15 new words in a foreign language per day, so if you practice
your vocabulary five days a week, after a week you can learn around 70 new words. After 1 month you will
have at least 250 new words in your notebook.

This single learning method is the most powerful way I know for improving your Vocabulary and lots of my
students have been successful with it. I bet you will do the same if you get your hand in learning vocabulary
with this simple 5-step plan.

## 16. Synonyms for Commonly-used Adjectives in IELTS Speaking & Writing

To achieve a high score in the IELTS test, you must show that you can use a fairly wide range of word
forms. _In this post I’m going to cover_ synonyms of various common adjectives used by IELTS learners.

An adjective is the most commonly-used type of word in IELTS which functions as modifiers of nouns,
typically by describing, delimiting, or specifying quantity, as beautiful in a beautiful woman.

A synonym is a word or expression with the same or a similar meaning as another word. For example, the
words beautiful and resplendent are synonyms used to describe something having great beauty.


Bear in mind that some synonyms in the list below might not be “perfect” synonyms – there may be slight
differences in meaning and connotation. For example, the words angry and mad. Both of them mean “feeling
or expressing annoyance” but the word mad also means being mentally deranged and foolish.

Synonyms are often used in different collocations, too. For example, we can describe either a person or
an idea as brilliant, but only a person can be astute.

The table below will furnish you with synonyms for the most common adjectives which can serve as an
adequate substitute in the IELTS test.
